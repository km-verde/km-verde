### Hi there, it's [Kayla](https://km-verde.github.io/) ðŸ‘‹

**Pronouns**: she/her

I'm a CS student based in metro-Atlanta, practicing and learning code whenever I can. My interests in computer science lie in human-computer interactions, digital storytelling, and assistive technologies.

Currently, I am a third year and first-generation student at **Georgia Tech** for my Bachelor's of Science and intend on pursuing Media and People as my threads. I'm interested in UI/UX, front-end development, and developing accessible technology but am open to exploring other fields, as well!

Besides computer science, I am also very interested in healthcare and medical research. Outside of school, I enjoy baking, watching horror movies, and playing/watching people play video games. I also heavily involve myself in the arts by playing the cello and sketching/drawing in my spare time.
